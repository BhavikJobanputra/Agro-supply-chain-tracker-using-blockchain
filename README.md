# Pharmatrac

Pharmatrac is a simple yet effective system for tracking pharmaceutical products and preventing counterfeiting during transportation. Our dashboard allows you to monitor the status of shipments in real time, ensuring that drugs remain authentic from pickup to delivery. This helps combat the issue of fake medicines, which is a significant problem in India, where about 25% of drugs are counterfeit or substandard according to a 2022 study by ASSOCHAM.

## Features

- **Real-Time Tracking:** Monitor shipments from pickup to delivery.
- **Anti-Counterfeiting Measures:** Prevent fake products from being swapped with genuine ones during transit.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard:** Easy-to-use interface for managing shipments.

## Challenges We Faced

Planning the front end was challenging. While integrating blockchain in a React app is relatively easy, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is harder because we must compile smart contracts online. We used Remix IDE to write, test, and deploy smart contracts, which simplified the process but still required effort to integrate blockchain into a traditional web stack.
